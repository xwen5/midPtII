                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In mordent days, with framework and style guidelines, everyone can craft a beautiful layout website easily. With semi flat design, cinemographs, giant landing page photography and many other elements people’s websites start to look the same. My main approach for building the website was trying to bring different user experience and designs to the potential visitors.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I interviewed three different people. They are all students at different stage of life. Some graduated and some are still in the school. The questions in my interview were focused on expectation and must have elements in a personal website. My main findings by conducting the interviews were that design and contents are two of the most important factors in building a personal website. The users did not provide detailed expectations for a personal website. They often did not know what they are exactly looking for because they have no experience of building personal websites. However, by conducting these interviews, I gain a deeper understanding of what is necessary for building a personal website.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on user interviews and competitor analysis, I constructed my feature value matrix. Nowadays, the world is highly emphasizing on usability and user experience. Therefore, I believe well written content and design are important features to include in the personal website. Also, for professional purpose, there will also be sections of resume and projects. Additional Links to other social media is also included in the feature value matrix.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cognitive walkthrough is a method used to identify potential usability issues in a user interface. The challenges for conducting cognitive walkthrough is that participants often do not understand what the task is looking.

            <h1>Summary of Findings</h1>
            <article>
                <section class="post-body">
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By conducting a series of user research and user testing, I found some usability issues with my websites. First, a few user responses from both user testing and cognitive walkthrough shows that the word used in the navigation bar is ambiguous. Some users had problems understand the difference between “about me “and “my work” sections. Also, the “news” section confuses users the most. Through cognitive walkthrough, users do not understand the purpose of the “news” section inside a personal website. Additionally, “my work” section is just picture of projects without any description.  Some users responded that putting more textual description or making the whole section a case study can provider better usability.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having incomplete content in a personal website can provide poor user experience. Building a personal website that contain full sections of resume, project case study and show cases can be quite challenge. However, linking some portions of the personal website to third party platforms such as bedance, LinkedIn for highly detailed information can be an applicable approach to the problem if the integration is not awkward. This approach might ensure a good user experience while providing detailed information and reducing maintenances cost. </p>

                <section class="post-body">
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building a complete personal website that contains resume, project show cases, and showing my personality throughout the design is hard and time consuming. After a series of user research and user testing, I begin to question the necessaries of putting everything complete inside a personal website. In real world, people often do not have time to discover someone by navigating and exploring his personal website. Keeping the content simple and less while also directing users to a third-party platform for more detailed information might be a better approach in terms of providing better user experience in real world settings.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I did to incorporate the finding was deleting “news” section. The “news” section is confusing for users and it is useless in terms of fitting into the website. For future changes, I plan to make the website simpler to understand and easier to navigate with one-page design that provide highlight of my professional experience while also directing user to my Behance or LinkedIn space for more detailed information. </p>
